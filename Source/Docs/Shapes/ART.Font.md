ART.Font {#ART-Font}
====================

ART.Font creates a shape based on text content using a custom Cuf√≥n-style font face.

It uses custom path rendering through [ART.Shape][] which is slower than native [ART.Text][].
Although it may give a more appealing rendering - especially when rotated. It also enables
custom font faces in more browsers.

### Extends:

- [ART.Shape][]

[ART.Shape]: ../ART/ART.Shape
[ART.Text]: ART.Text
