ART.Text {#ART-Text}
====================

ART.Text creates a shape based on text content using native text rendering.

Note: ART.Text doesn't support custom @font-face files when [VML] rendering is used.
You may use [ART.Font][] instead.

ART.Text doesn't directly inherit from [ART.Shape][] but implements the same methods.


[ART.Shape]: ../ART/ART.Shape
[ART.Font]: ART.Font
[VML]: ../Modes/ART.VML
